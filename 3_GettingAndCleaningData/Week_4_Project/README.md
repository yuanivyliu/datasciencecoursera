# **Getting and Cleaning Data Week 4 Project**

Code book, R script, and the tidy data text file for the peer graded assignment.

## **Files:**

1.  **Code_book.md** describes the how to use all this, variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

2.  **run_analysis.R** contains all the code to perform the analysis described in this 5 steps:

-   Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

-   Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

-   Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

-   Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

-   From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

3.  **tidy_data.txt** is the output of the final step.
